- 👋 Hi, I’m Ian Davis
- 👀 I’m interested in Cloud Infrastructure, Automation, Frontend development, and Backend development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning VueJS and a plethora of AWS services.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Fullstack development for some websites I'm working on in my spare time. I'm very much new to the frontend side of things so it's where I'm trying to improve.
